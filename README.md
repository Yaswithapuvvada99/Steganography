# Stenography
Image Steganography â€“ Hide Data Inside Images

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements image steganography, a technique for securely hiding secret messages within digital images. By modifying pixel values, the project ensures data remains concealed while maintaining the original image's appearance. It provides a simple yet effective way to prevent hackers from intercepting sensitive information.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Securely hides text messages within an image

âœ… Password protection for message decryption

âœ… Minimal distortion in the stego-image

âœ… Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP)

âœ… Lightweight and easy-to-use

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, OS

Security Mechanism: Password Authentication

ðŸ›  How It Works

Encryption:

The user enters a secret message and passcode.
The message is converted into ASCII values and embedded into the image pixels.
A modified image is generated with hidden data.

Decryption:

The user provides the encrypted image and correct passcode.
The program extracts hidden text from the image.
If the passcode is incorrect, access is denied.

ðŸ“Œ Future Scope

ðŸ”¹ Integration with AES/RSA encryption for enhanced security

ðŸ”¹ AI-based steganography to improve data hiding efficiency

ðŸ”¹ Support for audio/video steganography

ðŸ”¹ Cloud-based secure data sharing system
